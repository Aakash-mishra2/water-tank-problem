# Water Tank Problem

A simple web application to solve the **Water Tank Problem** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed to run locally using the Live Server extension for a seamless development and testing experience.


## Problem statement
Given `n` is always greater than -1, representing the block height. Now compute
the units of water stored in-between the blocks. Build a Web Application
(Frontend Solution) using Vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS to represent the
solution. Share the code and snippets in a Git repository

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:


## Features

- **Input Interface**: Accepts an array of integers representing heights.
- **Visualization**: Displays the height representation in a graphical format.
- **Solution Logic**: Implements the algorithm to calculate the maximum amount of water that can be trapped.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes.

## Requirements

- **Live Server Extension**: This application requires the Live Server extension in your code editor (e.g., VS Code) to run locally.
